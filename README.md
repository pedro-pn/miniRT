## About

This project is a recriation of miniRT from 42 school as an exercise to help me to fix some concepts of raytracing. The [original project](https://github.com/librity/ft_minirt) was made with [lpaulo-m](https://github.com/librity), but I decided to implement it from scratch using my own [libft](https://github.com/pedro-pn/libft_complete) and going further in The Ray Tracing Challange book chapters.

## Description

This project is a Ray Tracer coded in C using [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) library.
